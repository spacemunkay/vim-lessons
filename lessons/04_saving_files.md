# 04_saving_files

## NOTE: In case of emergency, just hit ESC and type :q!

So far, we've not been saving any changes to our files.  By quiting with :q! we force vim to quit without saving changes, otherwise it will prevent us from exiting when there are unsaved changes.

To save a file, you type :w

# Use insert mode (i, a, o) to alter some text in this file and then hit ESC and type :w to save your change.

Exciting stuff right? Well it gets more exciting.  If you want to save and quit, you can combine commands by typing :wq to save then quit.


# Save the file, then type the following to start the next lesson: :e 05_deleting_text.md
