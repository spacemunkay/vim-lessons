IT'S A TRAP!

The first trick to using vim is figuring out how to exit vim.  Unintuitively, pressing ESC alone will not close VIM.

To close VIM, hit the ESC key then type :q and hit ENTER.  If you made changes to the file, you will be prompted to instead type :q! which forces the command by adding the exclamation mark.

By typing ':' we are entering vim's command mode which we'll discuss more later.
