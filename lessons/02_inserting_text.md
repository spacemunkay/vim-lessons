## NOTE: In case of emergency, just hit ESC and type :q!

So far, you've been using vim in "normal" mode.  If you want to add text to a document you must switch to "insert" mode.  You can do this by pressing the following keys

* i
* a
* o
* I
* A
* O

To return to normal mode, just hit ESC.

# Try to add some text to this line by pressing 'i' while your cursor is on this line.

# Try to add some text to this line by pressing 'a' while your cursor is on this line.

# Try to add some text below this line by pressing 'o' while your cursor is on this line.

Did you figure out the difference between i, a, and o? What about their capitalized equivalents I, A, and O?
