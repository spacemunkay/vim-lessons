## NOTE: In case of emergency, just hit ESC and type :q!

It's time to bust out the CAPS!  You can change the capitalization of characters with gU or gu combined with a movement command like w or $.  Alternatively, you can highlight a word and then type U or u.

# Put the cursor over the word 'caps' and type gUw, then try gU$.

Now let's try indenting some stuff.  To indent lines, you can use the < and > commands combined with a movement or after highlighting.

# Go to the list item 'item five' and type >>, then >k, then >3j

* item one
* item two 
* item three
* item four
* item five
* item six
* item seven
* item eight

We can fix the indentations from the previous exercise by autoformatting.

You can autoformat using the = command with a movement command, or when texted is highlighted.

# Type =gg to autoformat everything above this line.
